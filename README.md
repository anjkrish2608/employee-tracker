## Description of Application
The Employee Tracker is a CLI application which prompts the user to Add, Update, Delete and View information on the employee_DB. The motivation behind the creation of this application is to streamline the employee management system by automating the process of creating, updating, deleting and viewing certain information stored on the database. 
The application can:
*CREATE*
    * add a new employee, role or department
*READ*
* view the employees and their attributes
* view the employees under a certain manager
* view the roles and their attributes
* view the departments and their attributes
* view certain departments' utilised budget
*UPDATE*
* update an employee's first or last name and their role's or manager's id
* update a role's title, salary or department's id
* update a department's name
*DELETE*
* delete an employee, role or department from the database

## Technologies Used
While creating this application I have used many different technologies listed below:

* JavaScript ES6 : to write all of the code inside server.js
* Node JS : to run the server.js file
* Inquirer Package : to ask the user for input
* MYSQL Package : to access the database I created
* Console.Table Package : to create a simple standard output for all tables

## Challenges Faced
Throughout the creation of this application I have faced many challenges. The main challenge I faced was due to syntax of course. When first implementing the add functions I was using incorrect syntax and kept returning an error. After much trial and error I finally saw the mistake in my syntax and learned from this. I found that at the beginning of this week I would not hae been able to complete this task but after repetitive revision and application I found that this task has helped me to understanf MYSQL.

## Features to be Implemented
In the future I would like to change the structure of the prompts so that the options are clearly available to the user for example the budget ability is not initially obvious to the user or the deleting capability.
